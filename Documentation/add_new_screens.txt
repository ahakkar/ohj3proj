1. Add a new enum to ScreenType.java
2. Add a new .fxml to resources/fi/sisusapp/view
3. Implement a new ViewModel based on abstract ViewModel class,
   and store it to /viewmodel where the other viewmodels are.
4. Implement a new view Controller based on abstract Controller class,
   and store it to /view where the other view controllers are.
5. Implement logic to switch between desired screens in the viewmodels.
